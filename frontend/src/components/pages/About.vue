        <p class='textpage__intro'>Love yourself as you are<br>and enjoy doing what you do</p>
        <p>My name is Kaori, a passionate beauty lover &amp; freelance makeup artist, hairstylist &amp; winner of the Talent Award of 2018 in The Netherlands. After finishing my Makeup Artist course at the Glamour Makeup I started freelancing straight away. </p>
        <p>During my career as a makeup artist &amp; hairstylist, Iâ€™ve been specializing in editorial work within the fashion and beauty industry. Along with that, I started to do commercials, advertising, corporate films, and private events.</p>
        <p>Over the years I also managed to obtain various publications in magazines and I also work for different brands within the Netherlands.</p>
