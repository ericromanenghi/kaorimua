        <p>Hello and Welcome!</p>

        <p>
            My name is Kaori and I am a Professional Makeup artist. I am originally from Buenos Aires city (Argentina) but I have been living in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) for the last couple of years.

            Since I was very young, I loved “playing” with makeup and I always identified myself as an artistic and creative person. That’s why, on 2018 I “took the leap of faith” and decided to take a professional makeup Course, and I loved every single minute of it!. 
        </p>

        <p>
            From that moment on, I couldn’t stop!, to gain more experience and to start creating content I started organizing photoshoots, I started to do some network with other (amazing!) professionals and also started accepting challenges and opportunities that I got from online researches. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I have also invested on getting even more professional trainings in different cities such as London (UK), Amsterdam (NL), Paris (Fr), Milano (It) and in Buenos Aires (Arg).
